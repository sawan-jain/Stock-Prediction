# Stock-Prediction Using DL 
This is a simple example of stock prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, making it well-suited for time series data like stock prices.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is historical stock price data, which includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and volume. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for training and evaluation of the LSTM model.

# Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:
  1) Python 
  2) TensorFlow 2
  3) Pandas
  4) NumPy
  5) Matplotlib
